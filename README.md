I am not currently maintaining this anymore. It was a fun project but it had issues that were annoying. I have also just ended up using a websocket library (https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket) for web support as well

# LibWork (LibGDX + Network)

LibWork is a network library based on [KryoNet](https://github.com/crykn/kryonet) for my own Java/LibGDX projects.

I made my own because I was having issues with KryoNet, primarily connecting/disconnecting hanging sometimes and making it really annoying to test. Happened over multiple machines and multiple projects.

[Related issue](https://github.com/crykn/kryonet/issues/7).

It was also just fun to learn how to make my own using Java NIO. At the moment I do not think it works on mobile due to using NIO, it was just IOS that did not work.

## Requirements

Java 17
